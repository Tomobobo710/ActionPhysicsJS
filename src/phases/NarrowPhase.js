/**
 * NarrowPhase: dispatch layer tying Midphase's primitive-shape pairs through GJK/EPA into
 * ContactDetails, and routing them into the right ContactManifold.
 *
 * Produces: contacts with accurate point, normal, signed distance (plan.md, Narrowphase contract).
 * May assume the pair is worth testing (a broadphase/midphase candidate). Must never cull contacts
 * for staleness, clamp depth, or second-guess its own math - that discipline lives entirely in
 * GJK/EPA/ContactDetails already; this file only wires them together and routes results into
 * manifolds. It owns exactly one thing of its own: one MinkowskiSupport/GJK/EPA instance PER
 * BODY-PAIR SLOT (reused across ticks for that slot, never shared across different pairs live at
 * the same time), and grouping this tick's contacts by canonical pair key before handing them to
 * ContactManifoldList.refresh().
